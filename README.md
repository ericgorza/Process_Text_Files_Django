# Process_Text_Files_Django
Process Text Files with Python Dictionaries and Upload to Running Web Service

This was my first attempt to make the code work. It needs to be more efficient.
Could've created one dictionary and appended it to a list of dictionaries.
It worked well for Qwiklabs Exercise.
